Weather Terms and Information:

Temperature Scales:
- Celsius (°C): The most commonly used temperature scale worldwide
- Fahrenheit (°F): Primarily used in the United States
- Conversion: °F = (°C × 9/5) + 32

Weather Conditions:
1. Clear/Sunny: No significant cloud cover, direct sunlight
2. Partly Cloudy: Some clouds present but not covering the entire sky
3. Overcast: Complete cloud coverage
4. Rain: Precipitation in liquid form
5. Thunderstorm: Storm with lightning and thunder
6. Snow: Frozen precipitation in the form of snowflakes
7. Fog: Low-lying clouds reducing visibility
8. Haze: Reduced visibility due to particles in the air

Weather Measurements:
- Temperature: Measures how hot or cold the air is
- Humidity: Amount of water vapor in the air
- Wind Speed: Usually measured in km/h or mph
- Precipitation: Amount of rain/snow measured in mm or inches
- Air Pressure: Measured in hectopascals (hPa) or millibars (mb)

Common Weather Phenomena:
1. Rainbow: Optical phenomenon occurring when sunlight interacts with water droplets
2. Lightning: Electrical discharge during storms
3. Hurricane/Cyclone: Severe tropical storm with wind speeds over 119 km/h
4. Tornado: Violently rotating column of air extending from a storm to the ground
5. Heat Wave: Extended period of unusually high temperatures
6. Cold Front: Leading edge of advancing cold air mass
7. Warm Front: Leading edge of advancing warm air mass

Weather Safety Tips:
1. During Thunder/Lightning:
   - Stay indoors
   - Avoid using electrical equipment
   - Stay away from tall objects if outdoors

2. During Extreme Heat:
   - Stay hydrated
   - Avoid direct sunlight
   - Use air conditioning or fans
   - Check on vulnerable people

3. During Heavy Rain/Flooding:
   - Avoid driving through flooded areas
   - Stay away from power lines
   - Move to higher ground if necessary

4. During Snow/Ice:
   - Drive carefully
   - Dress in layers
   - Keep emergency supplies ready

Climate vs Weather:
- Weather: Short-term conditions of the atmosphere
- Climate: Long-term average weather patterns in an area

Common Weather Effects:
1. UV Index: Measures intensity of solar radiation
2. Wind Chill: How cold it feels considering wind speed
3. Heat Index: How hot it feels considering humidity
4. Dew Point: Temperature at which water vapor condenses

Weather Forecasting Methods:
1. Satellite Imagery
2. Weather Radar
3. Weather Stations
4. Computer Models
5. Historical Data Analysis

Seasonal Weather Patterns:
- Spring: Generally mild temperatures, increased rainfall
- Summer: Warmer temperatures, longer daylight hours
- Autumn: Cooling temperatures, variable conditions
- Winter: Colder temperatures, possible snow/ice

Air Quality Information:
- AQI (Air Quality Index): Measures air pollution levels
- Common Pollutants: PM2.5, PM10, Ozone, NO2, SO2
- Health Impact: Poor air quality can affect respiratory health

Weather Impact on Daily Life:
1. Agriculture: Crop growth and harvesting
2. Transportation: Flight delays, road conditions
3. Energy Usage: Heating and cooling demands
4. Outdoor Activities: Sports and events
5. Health: Air quality and temperature effects
